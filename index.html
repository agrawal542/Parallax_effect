            <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.
                Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
                scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
                <br> <br>
                Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal,
                such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

            <p class="text">
                You can cycle as a mode of transport, for casual activity, or as an intense, competitive endeavour.
                Cycling is a wonderful workout that keeps you active.
                It can help shape a healthy lifestyle, both physically and mentally.
                <br> <br>
                The adventure and buzz you get from coasting down hills and being outdoors mean that you are more likely
                to continue
                to cycle regularly, compared to other physical activities that keep you indoors or require special times
                or places.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.
                <br> <br>
                The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing
                shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the
                wing,
                and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water,
                which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
                <br><br>
                Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves
                in the open ocean, in lakes,
                in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
